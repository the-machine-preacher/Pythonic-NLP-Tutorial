    "When registering an account for a new social media app or completing an order for a gift online, nearly every piece of information you enter into a web form is validated. Did you enter a properly formatted email including an `@` symbol? Did you enter a phone number `10` digits long, with or without `-`s and parentheses? And then there’s the king of them all — did your new password meet the seemingly growing number of requirements for inclusion (and exclusion) of symbols, digits, and both upper and lower case letters?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>While correcting each field in our digital lives for proper format can be a pain, it’s integral to ensuring that our accounts are secure, our packages are successfully delivered, and that we can be contacted by phone and email.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>The technology that fuels this verification system on nearly every website and application is the ever reliable, often quirky language of *regular expressions,* commonly shortened to regex, as we will use here, or regexp (pronunciation is up for debate). A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that describe a pattern of text that should be found, or matched, in a string or document. By matching text, we can identify how often and where certain pieces of text occur, as well as have the opportunity to replace or update these pieces of text if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Regular Expressions have a variety of use cases including:\n",
    "- Validating user input in HTML forms\n",
    "- Verifying and parsing text in files, code and applications\n",
    "- Examining test results\n",
    "- Finding keywords in emails and web pages\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>While there are a variety of implementations of Regular Expressions across platforms, in this lesson you will learn the basics that apply everywhere. By the lesson’s end, you’ll be empowered to use them in your own projects (and become a regex superhero)!"

    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "The simplest text we can match with regular expressions are *literals.* This is where our regular expression contains the exact text that we want to match. The regex `a`, for example, will match the text `a`, and the regex `bananas` will match the text `bananas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>We can additionally match just part of a piece of text. Perhaps we are searching a document to see if the word `monkey` occurs, since we love monkeys. We could use the regex `monkey` to match `monkey` in the piece of text `The monkeys like to eat bananas.`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Not only are we able to match alphabetical characters — digits work as well! The regex `3` will match the `3` in the piece of text `34`, and the regex `5` gibbons will completely match the text `5 gibbons`!\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Regular expressions operate by moving character by character, from left to right, through a piece of text. When the regular expression finds a character that matches the first piece of the expression, it looks to find a continuous sequence of matching characters."

You can find either of them with the same regular expression using *alternation!* Alternation, performed in regular expressions with the pipe symbol, `|`, allows us to match either the characters preceding the `|` OR the characters after the `|`. The regex `baboons|gorillas` will match `baboons` in the text `I love baboons`, but will also match `gorillas` in the text `I love gorillas`.\n",

    "----\n",
    "Spelling tests may seem like a distant memory from grade school, but we ultimately take them every day while typing. It’s easy to make mistakes on commonly misspelled words like `consensus`, and on top of that, there are sometimes alternate spellings for the same word.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Character sets, denoted by a pair of brackets `[]`, let us match one character from a series of characters, allowing for matches with incorrect or different spellings.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>The regex `con[sc]en[sc]us` will match `consensus`, the correct spelling of the word, but also match the following three incorrect spellings: `concensus`, `consencus`, and `concencus`. The letters inside the first brackets, `s` and `c`, are the different possibilities for the character that comes after `con` and before `en`. Similarly for the second brackets, `s` and `c` are the different character possibilities to come after `en` and before `us`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Thus the regex `[cat]` will match the characters `c`, `a`, or `t`, but not the text `cat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>The beauty of character sets (and alternation) is that they allow our regular expressions to become more flexible and less rigid than by just matching with literals!\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>We can make our character sets even more powerful with the help of the caret `^` symbol. Placed at the front of a character set, the `^` negates the set, matching any character that is *not* stated. These are called *negated character sets.* Thus the regex `[^cat]` will match any character that is not `c`, `a`, or `t`, and would completely match each character `d`, `o` or `g`.\n",

    "Character sets are great, but their true power isn’t realized without ranges. *Ranges* allow us to specify a range of characters in which we can make a match without having to type out each individual character. The regex `[abc]`, which would match any character `a`, `b`, or `c`, is equivalent to regex range `[a-c]`. The `-` character allows us to specify that we are interested in matching a range of characters.\n",

    "*Regular Expressions*\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "While character ranges are extremely useful, they can be cumbersome to write out every single time you want to match common ranges such as those that designate alphabetical characters or digits. To alleviate this pain, there are *shorthand character classes* that represent common ranges, and they make writing regular expressions much simpler. These shorthand classes include:\n",
    "- `\\w`: the “word character” class represents the regex range `[A-Za-z0-9_]`, and it matches a single uppercase character, lowercase character, digit or underscore\n",
    "- `\\d`: the “digit character” class represents the regex range `[0-9]`, and it matches a single digit character\n",
    "- `\\s`: the “whitespace character” class represents the regex range `[ \\t\\r\\n\\f\\v]`, matching a single space, tab, carriage return, line break, form feed, or vertical tab\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>For example, the regex `\\d\\s\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w` matches a digit character, followed by a whitespace character, followed by 7 word characters. Thus the regex completely matches the text `3 monkeys`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>In addition to the shorthand character classes `\\w`, `\\d`, and `\\s`, we also have access to the negated shorthand character classes! These shorthands will match any character that is NOT in the regular shorthand classes. These negated shorthand classes include:\n",
    "- `\\W`: the “non-word character” class represents the regex range `[^A-Za-z0-9_]`, matching any character that is not included in the range represented by `\\w`\n",
    "- `\\D`: the “non-digit character” class represents the regex range `[^0-9]`, matching any character that is not included in the range represented by `\\d`\n",

    "\n",
    "<br/>But what if we want to match the whole piece of text `I love baboons` and `I love gorillas` with the same regex? Your first guess might be to use the regex `I love baboons|gorillas`. This regex, while it would completely match the string `I love baboons`, would not match `I love gorillas`, and would instead match `gorillas`. This is because the `|` symbol matches the *entire* expression before or after itself.\n",

But instead of writing the regex `\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\s\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w`, which would match 6 word characters, followed by a whitespace character, and then followed by more 6 word characters, such as in the text `rhesus monkey`, is there a better way to denote the quantity of characters we want to match?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>The answer is yes, with the help of quantifiers! *Fixed quantifiers,* denoted with curly braces `{}`, let us indicate the exact quantity of a character we wish to match, or allow us to provide a quantity range to match on.\n",
    "- `\\w{3}` will match exactly 3 word characters\n",
    "- `\\w{4,7}` will match at minimum 4 word characters and at maximum 7 word characters\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>The regex `roa{3}r` will match the characters `ro` followed by `3` `a`s, and then the character `r`, such as in the text `roaaar`. The regex `roa{3,7}r` will match the characters `ro` followed by at least `3` `a`s and at most `7` `a`s, followed by an `r`, matching the strings `roaaar`, `roaaaaar` and `roaaaaaaar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>An important note is that quantifiers are considered to be *greedy*. This means that they will match the greatest quantity of characters they possibly can. For example, the regex `mo{2,4}` will match the text `moooo` in the string `moooo`, and not return a match of `moo`, or `mooo`. This is because the fixed quantifier wants to match the largest number of `o`s as possible, which is `4` in the string `moooo`."

Optional quantifiers to the rescue!\n",
