# The 'Pythonic' Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tutorial!
Natural language processing (NLP) is all about how computers work with human language. From your virtual assistant recommending a restaurant to that terrible autocorrect you sent your cousin, the field is a rapidly growing presence in our lives. NLP can be conducted in several programming languages. However, Python has some of the most extensive open-source NLP libraries, including the Natural Language Toolkit or NLTK. Because of this, I’ll be using Python to introduce NLP. This guide assumes the reader is familiar with the Python programming language.
