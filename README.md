# The 'Pythonic' Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tutorial!
Natural language processing (NLP) is all about how computers work with human language. From your virtual assistant recommending a restaurant to that terrible autocorrect you sent your cousin, the field is a rapidly growing presence in our lives. NLP can be conducted in several programming languages. However, Python has some of the most extensive open-source NLP libraries, including the Natural Language Toolkit or NLTK. Because of this, Iâ€™ll be using Python to introduce NLP. This guide assumes the reader is familiar with the Python programming language.
